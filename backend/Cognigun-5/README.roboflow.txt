Roboflow is an end-to-end computer vision platform that helps you
* collaborate with your team on computer vision projects
* collect & organize images
* understand and search unstructured image data
* annotate, and create datasets
* export, train, and deploy computer vision models
* use active learning to improve your dataset over time

The dataset includes 760 images.
Guns-handguns-pistols are annotated in YOLOv9 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)
* Grayscale (CRT phosphor)
* Auto-contrast via adaptive equalization

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -10° to +10° horizontally and -10° to +10° vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -20 and +20 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.1 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.29 percent of pixels
